ABSTRACT
This review synthesizes current research on Artificial Intelligence, particularly focusing on Deep Learning (DL). DL has emerged as a gold standard in Machine Learning, consistently outperforming conventional techniques across diverse applications like cybersecurity, NLP, and bioinformatics. Its success is attributed to automatic feature extraction and the ability to leverage massive datasets and advanced hardware. The continuous growth in data availability and High-Performance Computing drives novel studies, positioning DL at the forefront of complex cognitive task resolution, often matching or exceeding human performance.

METHODS COMPARISON
The provided analysis data primarily details the methodology of one comprehensive review paper. This paper employed a survey methodology, reviewing over 300 significant research papers published between 2010 and 2021, with a strong emphasis on 2019-2020. Papers were selected from reputed publishers (IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, Nature, ACM, Springer) and ArXiv, using keywords such as "Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," and "Convolution." The review aimed to define DL approaches, explain CNN architectures, present challenges and solutions, assess applications, and evaluate computational approaches. Methodologies for the other two papers are unavailable due to an API issue, preventing a comparative analysis of research designs, data collection, or analytical techniques across all included studies.

RESULTS SYNTHESIS
The available research consistently highlights Deep Learning (DL) as a transformative force within Machine Learning (ML). Key findings indicate that DL has become the "Gold Standard," achieving outstanding results that frequently match or surpass human performance in complex cognitive tasks. This superiority is largely driven by DL's capacity for automatic feature extraction, significantly reducing the need for human-engineered features and domain-specific knowledge. Consequently, DL consistently outperforms traditional neural networks and other ML techniques across a broad spectrum of applications, including cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics, and medical information processing. The continuous expansion and emergence of novel DL studies are directly linked to the exponential increase in data availability and substantial advancements in hardware technologies, particularly High-Performance Computing (HPC). Results from the other two papers are unavailable, limiting a broader synthesis of findings.

DISCUSSION
The findings underscore the profound impact of Deep Learning on the field of Artificial Intelligence. DL's ability to automatically learn complex features from vast datasets, coupled with advancements in computational power, has propelled it to the forefront of solving previously intractable problems. This has significant implications for various industries, promising enhanced automation, more accurate predictions, and novel solutions across scientific and commercial domains. However, the reliance on massive datasets also presents challenges related to data privacy, bias, and the computational resources required for training. Future research directions will likely focus on addressing these challenges, exploring more efficient architectures, developing explainable AI (XAI) for better interpretability, and extending DL's application to new frontiers. The current review's primary limitation is the incomplete data from two of the three analyzed papers, which restricts a comprehensive comparison of methodologies and a broader synthesis of results. Future reviews would benefit from complete access to all paper details to provide a more robust and comparative analysis.

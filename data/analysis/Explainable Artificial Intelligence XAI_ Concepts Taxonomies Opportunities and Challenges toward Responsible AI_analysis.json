    "abstract": "In the last few years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the ﬁeld. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) ﬁeld, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the ﬁeld of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to deﬁne explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel deﬁnition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this deﬁnition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artiﬁcial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the ﬁeld of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the beneﬁts of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) lies at the core of many activity sectors that have embraced new information technologies [1]. While the roots of AI trace back to several decades ago, there is a clear consensus on the paramount importance featured nowadays by intelligent machines endowed with learning, reasoning and adaptation capabilities. It is by virtue of these capabilities that AI methods are achieving unprecedented levels of performance when learning to solve increasingly complex computational tasks, making them pivotal for the future development of the human society [2]. The sophistication of AI-powered systems has lately increased to such an extent that almost no human intervention is required for their design and deployment. When decisions derived from such systems ultimately affect humans’ lives (as in e.g. medicine, law or defense), there is an emerging need for understanding how such decisions are furnished by AI methods [3].\nWhile the very ﬁrst AI systems were easily interpretable, the last years have witnessed the rise of opaque decision systems such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The empirical success of Deep Learning (DL) models such as DNNs stems from a combination of efﬁcient learning algorithms and their huge parametric space. The latter space comprises hundreds of layers and millions of parameters, which makes DNNs be considered as complex black-box models [4]. The opposite of black-box-ness is transparency, i.e., the search for a direct understanding of the mechanism by which a model works [5].\nAs black-box Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed to make important predictions in critical contexts, the demand for transparency is increasing from the various stakeholders in AI [6]. The danger is on creating and using decisions that are not justiﬁable, legitimate, or that simply do not allow obtaining detailed explanations of their behaviour [7]. Explanations supporting the output of a model are crucial, e.g., in precision medicine, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary prediction for supporting their diagnosis [8]. Other examples include autonomous vehicles in transportation, security, and ﬁnance, among others.\nIn general, humans are reticent to adopt techniques that are not directly interpretable, tractable and trustworthy [9], given the increasing demand for ethical AI [3]. It is customary to think that by focusing solely on performance, the systems will be increasingly opaque. This is true in the sense that there is a trade-off between the performance of a model and its transparency [10]. However, an improvement in the understanding of a system can lead to the correction of its deﬁciencies. When developing a ML model, the consideration of interpretability as an additional design driver can improve its implementability for 3 reasons:\n• Interpretability helps ensure impartiality in decision-making, i.e. to detect, and consequently, correct from bias in the training dataset.\n• Interpretability facilitates the provision of robustness by highlighting potential adversarial perturbations that could change the prediction.\n• Interpretability can act as an insurance that only meaningful variables infer the output, i.e., guaranteeing that an underlying truthful causality exists in the model reasoning.\nAll these means that the interpretation of the system should, in order to be considered practical, provide either an understanding of the model mechanisms and predictions, a visualization of the model’s discrimination rules, or hints on what could perturb the model [11].\nIn order to avoid limiting the effectiveness of the current generation of AI systems, eXplainable AI (XAI) [7] proposes creating a suite of ML techniques that 1) produce more explainable models while maintaining a high level of learning performance (e.g., prediction accuracy), and 2) enable humans to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artiﬁcially intelligent partners. XAI draws as well insights from the Social Sciences [12] and considers the psychology of explanation.\nFigure 1 displays the rising trend of contributions on XAI and related concepts. This literature outbreak shares its rationale with the research agendas of national governments and agencies. Although some recent surveys [8, 13, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17] summarize the upsurge of activity in XAI across sectors and disciplines, this overview aims to cover the creation of a complete uniﬁed framework of categories and concepts that allow for scrutiny and understanding of the ﬁeld of XAI methods. Furthermore, we pose intriguing thoughts around the explainability of AI models in data fusion contexts with regards to data privacy and model conﬁdentiality. This, along with other research opportunities and challenges identiﬁed throughout our study, serve as the pull factor toward Responsible Artiﬁcial Intelligence, term by which we refer to a series of AI principles to be necessarily met when deploying AI in real applications. As we will later show in detail, model explainability is among the most crucial aspects to be ensured within this methodological framework. All in all, the novel contributions of this overview can be summarized as follows:\n1. Grounded on a ﬁrst elaboration of concepts and terms used in XAI-related research, we propose a novel deﬁnition of explainability that places audience (Figure 2) as a key aspect to be considered when explaining a ML model. We also elaborate on the diverse purposes sought when using XAI techniques, from trustworthiness to privacy awareness, which round up the claimed importance of purpose and targeted audience in model explainability.\n2. We deﬁne and examine the different levels of transparency that a ML model can feature by itself, as well as the diverse approaches to post-hoc explainability, namely, the explanation of ML models that are not transparent by design.\n3. We thoroughly analyze the literature on XAI and related concepts published to date, covering approximately 400 contributions arranged into two different taxonomies. The ﬁrst taxonomy addresses the explainability of ML models using the previously made distinction between transparency and post-hoc explainability, including models that are transparent by themselves, Deep and non-Deep (i.e., shallow) learning models. The second taxonomy deals with XAI methods suited for the explanation of Deep Learning models, using classiﬁcation criteria closely linked to this family of ML methods (e.g. layerwise explanations, representation vectors, attention).\n4. We enumerate a series of challenges of XAI that still remain insufﬁciently addressed to date. Speciﬁcally, we identify research needs around the concepts and metrics to evaluate the explainability of ML models, and outline research directions toward making Deep Learning models more understandable. We further augment the scope of our prospects toward the implications of XAI techniques in regards to conﬁdentiality, robustness in adversarial settings, data diversity, and other areas intersecting with explainability.\n5. After the previous prospective discussion, we arrive at the concept of Responsible Artiﬁcial Intelligence, a manifold concept that imposes the systematic adoption of several AI principles for AI models to be of practical use. In addition to explainability, the guidelines behind Responsible AI establish that fairness, accountability and privacy should also be considered when implementing AI models in real environments.\n6. Since Responsible AI blends together model explainability and privacy/security by design, we call for a profound reﬂection around the beneﬁts and risks of XAI techniques in scenarios dealing with sensitive information and/or conﬁdential ML models. As we will later show, the regulatory push toward data privacy, quality, integrity and governance demands more efforts to assess the role of XAI in this arena. In this regard, we provide an insight on the implications of XAI in terms of privacy and security under different data fusion paradigms.\nThe remainder of this overview is structured as follows: ﬁrst, Section 2 and subsections therein open a discussion on the terminology and concepts revolving around explainability and interpretability in AI, ending up with the aforementioned novel deﬁnition of interpretability (Subsections 2.1 and 2.2), and a general criterion to categorize and analyze ML models from the XAI perspective. Sections 3 and 4 proceed by reviewing recent ﬁndings on XAI for ML models (on transparent models and post-hoc techniques respectively) that comprise the main division in the aforementioned taxonomy. We also include a review on hybrid approaches among the two, to attain XAI. Beneﬁts and caveats of the synergies among the families of methods are discussed in Section 5, where we present a prospect of general challenges and some consequences to be cautious about. Finally, Section 6 elaborates on the concept of Responsible Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Section 7 concludes the survey with an outlook aimed at engaging the community around this vibrant research area, which has the potential to impact society, in particular those sectors that have progressively embraced ML as a core technology of their activity.",
